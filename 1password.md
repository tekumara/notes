# 1password

Unique features:

- remembers how you signed into sites using SSO rather than password
- unlock vault via TouchId on Mac
- can share vault items via a link with folks who don't have 1password
- can input password into desktop apps
- uses a secret key + password to lock vault - means password key logging is insufficient
