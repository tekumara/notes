# testing theory

"writing a test you are putting up a barrier to prevent something from being changed. The thing you actually want to prevent being changed though is the behaviour/use case. You actually want the implementation to be as easy to change as possible so that's not what you should be asserting on."

"Refactoring by definition is the act of change, so for me it follows that good tests describe behaviour while allowing its implementation to change."


- software enginering over time and space, not a single artifact but a evolving system  

- correctness


- analogy - scaffolding and tools to work on the building site, `make install test`
- sapi example (ryan)
- if you like it put a test on it (beyonce rule)

- document intent/behaviour of system, correct - and provides feedback 
- test-first development



- property-based testing
- flaky tests

- testability - test as design
