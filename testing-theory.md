# testing theory

"writing a test you are putting up a barrier to prevent something from being changed. The thing you actually want to prevent being changed though is the behaviour/use case. You actually want the implementation to be as easy to change as possible so that's not what you should be asserting on."

"Refactoring by definition is the act of change, so for me it follows that good tests describe behaviour while allowing its implementation to change."
