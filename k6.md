## Dropped iterations

From [Dropped iterations](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/scenarios/concepts/dropped-iterations/#dropped-iterations):

> Dropped iterations usually happen for one of two reasons:
>
> The executor configuration is insufficient.
> The SUT can't handle the configured VU arrival rate.

Increase VUs or drop request rate.
