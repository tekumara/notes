# vscode-github-auth

VS Code has a built in Github Authentication process. It detects actions that require authentication to [https://github.com](https://github.com), including changing into a directory with a [https://github.com](https://github.com) repo, or cloning a new [https://github.com](https://github.com) URL in the terminal. If git credentials are missing for [https://github.com](https://github.com), it will use the GitHub for VSCode OAuth app to generate them.

On first usage, you'll be unauthenticated and asked to [authorise the GitHub for VSCode OAuth app](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_authenticating-with-an-existing-repository) as follows:

1. VS Code will ask `The extension GitHub wants to sign in using GitHub`. Click `Allow`.
1. You'll be taken to a `https://vscode-auth.github.com/` authorization page. When asked `Authorize Visual Studio Code to access GitHub` click `Continue`.
1. If GitHub for VSCode has not already been authorised your account, you'll be asked to authorise it. Click `Authorise github`
1. On the Success page popup click `Open Visual Studio Code` to be taken back to VS Code.
1. When VS Code asks `Allow an extension to open this URI?` click `Allow`.

Once complete, the Github Authentication process generates the keychain item `vscodevscode.github-authentication` which is used to generate session tokens.

It also generates a session token which is passed to `credential-osxkeychain` for storing as the `github.com` keychain item. This allows `git` commands to authenticate to [https://github.com](https://github.com) URLs as you.

The logs for the authentication process are visible in `Output - GitHub Authentication`.

If the `github.com` keychain item is deleted, the VS Code Github Authentication process will regenerate it.

## Signing out

In VS Code, click the profile icon in the bottom left. Choose your GitHub account and select `Sign out`.

This invalidates GitHub for VSCode credentialsÂ (ie: the `vscodevscode.github-authentication` keychain item) on your machine.

Note the GitHub for VSCode OAuth app will still be authorized. To revoke it, visit [Applications settings](https://github.com/settings/applications).
