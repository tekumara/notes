# make

A Makefile is a template, which is first read in and variable expansion/substitution is applied.

After expansion, one or more targets are executed. Each line in a target's recipe is a shell command that is executed inside its own shell.

Variable expansion happens first, so in this example `echo Hi` will never be executed.

```makefile
test:
    echo Hi
    $(error I died)
```

- [How make Reads a Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Reading-Makefiles.html)
- [How do I write the 'cd' command in a makefile?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1789616/149412)

## Line prefixes

[Line prefixes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3477292/what-do-and-do-as-prefixes-to-recipe-lines-in-make):

- `-` ignore and continue if the command fails
- `@` suppresses the normal 'echo' of the command that is executed.

## Conditionals

eg: `ifeq`

"A conditional causes part of a makefile to be obeyed or ignored depending on the values of variables. Conditionals can compare the value of one variable to another, or the value of a variable to a constant string. Conditionals control what make actually "sees" in the makefile, so they cannot be used to control shell commands at the time of execution." [ref](https://web.mit.edu/gnu/doc/html/make_7.html) [ref](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11994561/149412):

`ifdef` will be ignored if it appears after commands in a target,
eg: this works

```
foo:
    echo foo
baz = baz
ifdef noswap
    noswap-flag = --noswap
else
    noswap-flag =
endif

bar:
    echo "$(noswap-flag)"
```

this doesn't

```
foo:
    echo foo

ifdef noswap
    noswap-flag = --noswap
else
    noswap-flag =
endif

bar:
    echo "$(noswap-flag)"
```

"The if function provides support for conditional expansion in a functional context (as opposed to the GNU make makefile conditionals such as ifeq (see Syntax of Conditionals)."
[8.4 Functions for Conditionals](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Conditional-Functions.html#Conditional-Functions)

## Variable assignment

`VARIABLE = value` - lazy set, values within it are (recursively) expanded **everytime** the variable is used, not when it's declared.
`VARIABLE := value` - immediate set, values within it are expanded at declaration time

When you want "call" a variable with arguments, use `=`, eg:

```
check_contains = $(if $(findstring $2,$1),,$(error Expecting $2 in $1))
```

If you use `:=` then the result of the call will be empty string.

`define` is useful for defining multi-line variables, see [6.8 Defining Multi-Line Variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Multi_002dLine.html#Multi_002dLine)

## Variable substitution

No difference between `$(var)` and `${var}`. Its recommended to be consistent. Note that `${var}` can be used in bash, whereas `$(var)` can't. [ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25185607/whats-the-difference-between-parenthesis-and-curly-bracket-syntax-in-ma)

## Undefined variables

To warn on undefined variables:

```
MAKEFLAGS += --warn-undefined-variables
```

NB: `$(value varname)` resolves to empty string if varname is undefined, and won't ever print a warning.

To select the value of the first defined variable or return empty string:

```
TAG=$(or $(value TAG),$(value tag))
```

## Shell

Allows you to run shell commands and have their values stored in a variable, eg: `FILES:=$(shell ls)`

If using simple variables, eg: `FILES=$(shell ls)` note that shell will be executed every time `$(FILES)` is referenced [ref](https://electric-cloud.com/blog/2009/03/makefile-performance-shell/)

https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Shell-Function.html

## Phony

If you want a target to be called regardless of if there is file with the target name in the same directory, use `.PHONY: mytarget` or `.PHONY: *` to make always execute all targets. https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html

## Ignore timestamp of dependency

To trigger a target only when a dependency does not exist use an [order-only prerequisite](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Prerequisite-Types). Order-only prerequisites arenâ€™t used to determine if the target is out of date.

eg:

```
dbt_packages: packages.yml | $(venv)
```

Will trigger `dbt_packages` when `$(venv)` does not exist, but if `$(venv)` is newer than `dbt_packages`, then `dbt_packages` won't be considered out of date.

NB: this is not transitive, ie: given

```
$(venv): pyproject.toml $(pip)
  ...

hooks: | $(venv)
  ...
```

`make hooks` will still build `$(venv)` when `pyproject.toml` is newer than `$(venv)`, causing `$(venv)` to be out of date.

## Always trigger a target

```
.terraform%:
	terraform init -reconfigure

## init
init: .terraform-phony
```

- `make .terraform` runs only if .terraform is out of date (ie: doesn't exist)
- `make init` always runs the .terraform target

NB: The `phony` suffix in `.terraform-phony` is not special. Any suffix will trigger the `.terraform%` target, and because it doesn't match any existing _.terraform_ directory, will always mean the target is not up to date and so doesn't run.

## Errors

```
awk '/^##.*$/,/^[~\/\.a-zA-Z_-]+:/' $(MAKEFILE_LIST)
```

`Makefile:17: warning: undefined variable /'` - need to use `$$` instead of `$`

## Comments

`#` marks a comment however variable expansion will still occur!

eg: `# $(FILES := $(shell ls))` will still execute `ls` even when commented!

## Target with % wildcard

`$*` will be replaced with the stem, ie: whatever `%` matches, eg:

```
# Check for specific environment variables
env-%:
    @ if [ "${${*}}" = "" ]; then \
        echo "Environment variable $* not set"; \
        exit 1; \
    fi

# -----------------------------------------
# Template creation

mappings-for-image: env-AWS_REGION env-IMAGE_ID
    mkdir -p build/
    printf "Mappings:\n  AWSRegion2AMI:\n    %s: { AMI: %s }\n" \
        "$(AWS_REGION)" $(IMAGE_ID) > build/mappings.yml
```

## String replacement

Patsubst matches whole words, eg: `$(patsubst %un,a,run something)` will resolve to `a something`

subst matches text occurrences, eg: `$(subst u,a,run something)` will resolve to `ran something`

[Text-Functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html)

## Eval

[Eval](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Eval-Function.html#Eval-Function) will parse its contents as Makefile syntax. Its useful for setting a variable from the result of a shell command within a target, eg:

```
time-one-min-ago:
    $(eval timemillis = $(shell echo "($$(date +%s)-(60))*1000" | bc))
    echo $(timemillis)
```

The shell command above only runs when the target is executed.

Alternatively, to perform a shell command only when a specific target runs (and not all targets), scope the variable definition to the target, eg:

```
time-one-min-ago: timemillis = $(shell echo "($$(date +%s)-(60))*1000" | bc)
time-one-min-ago:
    echo $(timemillis)
```

## Missing separator

Make sure the target line begins with a tab.

## Wildcards

Wildcards can be used to match a pattern to an explicit subdirectory level, eg:

```
# match match every file in `src` but not any subdirectories
src/*

# match match every file in `src` and the first level of subdirectories
src/*/*

# match every file in `src` and two levels of subdirectories
src/*/*/*

# recursively match all subdirectory levels, and also match hidden files
$(shell find src)
```

The wildcard function, eg: `$(wildcard src/*)` is the same as explicit wildcards, except for in the empty case. See [Pitfalls of Using Wildcards](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Wildcard-Pitfall.html#Wildcard-Pitfall)

## List all targets

```
.PHONY: list
list:
	@$(MAKE) -pRrq -f $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST)) : 2>/dev/null  \
	| awk -v RS= -F: '/^# File/,/^# Finished Make data base/ {if ($$1 !~ "^[#.]") {print $$1}}' \
	| sort \
	| egrep -v -e '^[^[:alnum:]]' -e '^$@$$'
```

## Debug

Show debug

```
make --debug=v install
```

Print the commands that would be executed

```
make --just-print
```

See [Chapter 12. Debugging Makefiles](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-projects-with/0596006101/ch12.html)

## Ignore target

```
make -o FILE test
```

`FILE` is never remade when it's dependencies are newer.

## Force up-to-date target to run

```
make -B test
```

## cat build.sh > build

When I run `make build` on my macOS laptop it gets right to the end and then errors with:

```
cat build.sh >build
/bin/sh: build: Is a directory
make: *** [build] Error 1
```

This is because the `build` target has no recipe, and since there's a build.sh file, make runs [a weird SCCS built-in rule](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43264686/why-does-calling-make-with-a-shell-script-target-create-an-executable-file).

`.PHONY: build` will fix this. Alternatively, add a recipe for the `build` target, or rename `build.sh`
