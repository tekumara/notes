# file managers

## nnn

`?` help  
`d` show file time and size
`tt` sort by time descending
`g` go to top
`return` or `rt arrow` will open using the default opener (eg: `open` on macos). Does nothing if there is no default opener.

Familiar vim keyboard shortcuts.

`nnn -e` will open files using `$EDITOR`. This is useful because it will open files that `open` can't open.

## lf

`st` sort by time ascending
`za` show date and size  
reverse sort ?
