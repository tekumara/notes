See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7251477/what-are-the-differences-between-double-dot-and-triple-dot-in-git-dif/7256391#7256391)

`git diff main..HEAD` shows the difference between the tips of main and HEAD, same as `main HEAD`
`git diff main...HEAD` shows the difference between the merge base of the two branches, and the tip of `HEAD`
