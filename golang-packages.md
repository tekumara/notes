## main

"The package “main” tells the Go compiler that the package should compile as an executable program instead of a shared library. The main function in the package “main” will be the entry point of our executable program. When you build shared libraries, you will not have any main package and main function in the package." - see [Understanding Golang Packages](https://thenewstack.io/understanding-golang-packages/)
