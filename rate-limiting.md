# rate limiting

## adaptive retires

Retries

- Jitter is good
- Retries can introduce tipping point failures
- Using a token bucket avoids this failure mode
- Backoff isnâ€™t very effective in open systems

## concurrency control

This makes a good argument that concurrency control is better than rate limiting, because it creates backpressure when latency increases (eg: due to server overload).
