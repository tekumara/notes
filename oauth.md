# oauth

OAuth Device authorization flow allows use of a one-time code ([example](https://github.com/cli/cli/pull/1522)). Useful for apps that don't have a web browser, eg: CLI tools.

OAuth Web application authorization flow requires callbacks, ie: something running on localhost listening for the callback.
