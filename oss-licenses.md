# OSS Licenses

## Apache

[The Apache License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) contains both a patent grant and a patent retaliation clause. From [this stack overflow answer](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/a/7965):

> Contributors provide a patent grant to any of their patents that would be infringed by their contributions. Therefore, no bad actor can inject code and later claim that this infringes their patents.
>
> If anyone claims that the software infringes their patents, their patent license from (other) contributors ceases. This prevents bad actors from simultaneously enjoying the use of the software while trying to deny others the use. Furthermore, this offers some amount of legal shielding for contributors against claims by unrelated entities.

Trademarks are not granted:

> This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

Overall less legal ambiguity than MIT and preferred by corporations. Favours end user over contributors who grant patent licenses. Protects against patent trolls.
