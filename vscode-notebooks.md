## Visualising pandas output

Resizing pandas DataFrame output columns is an open [feature request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/174917).

Wide output columns are truncated by default. This is a pandas setting and can be changed see [display options](pandas.md#display)

Clicking on `...` and switching to the text/plain output might be useful in some cases.
