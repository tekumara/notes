# DNS

## Search domains

search domains (can be multiple) are appended when a single label hostname without a dot is used.
They can be specified in /etc/resolv.conf (see man resolv.conf) eg:

```
# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
nameserver 127.0.1.1
search localdomain myremotedomain.com
```

A better way though is via [[NetworkManager]]

## resolv.conf

/etc/resolv.conf is auto-generated, to see details about the actual nameservers: `systemd-resolve --status`

## Reverse lookup

```
$ nslookup 52.95.132.38

Server:		127.0.0.53
Address:	127.0.0.53#53
