To use Page Up/Page Down for scrolling only when in non-interactive apps (eg: when at the command line, but not in TUI apps like k9s, dive etc.) then check "Preferences -> Profiles -> Choose profile -> Keys -> General -> Page up, page down, home and end scroll outside interactive apps". NB: This will be overridden by specific key bindings for Page Up/Page Down, so make sure you don't have any in Preferences -> Keys -> Key Bindings.
